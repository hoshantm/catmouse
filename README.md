Game of Cat and Mouse

This is a further analysis of the solution of the Game of Cat and Mouse - Numberphile puzzle described on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF_-ob9vseM&t=385s). It addresses two areas:

- Initial conditions that allow a straight line escape
- Optimum spiral path equation prior to "dash" escape

Extensive comments are provided in the Python code to explained what is being done. The code is not optimal but is sufficient for the purpose of providing a useful analysis.
